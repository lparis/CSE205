 * Mammal implements the MakesSound interface, so since Dog is a subclass of
 * Mammal then Dog must implement the MakesSound interface by implementing the
 * MakesSound.makeSound() method. (If Dog does not do this, then Dog also becomes
 * an abstract class).

     * of Mammal. Therefore, to prevent accidental overloading, we use the
     * @Override annotation.
