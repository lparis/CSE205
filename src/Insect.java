// ABSTRACT CLASS: Insect (Insect.java)
//
// DESCRIPTION
// Insect is the abstract superclass for all Insect subclasses, e.g., we could
// have a LadyBug class, a Cockroach class, and a Cricket class, all of which
// inherit from Insect. The Insect class implements the MakesSound interface
// because each Insect makes a sound of some sort (we assume so, I don't know if
// all Insects make sounds).
