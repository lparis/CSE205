 * Cricket is a specific type of Insect so Cricket inherits from Insect. Insect
 * and Cricket are related using a generalization (or inheritance) relationship.
 * Note that Insect implements the MakesSound interface, so since Cricket is a
 * subclass of Insect then Cricket must implement the MakesSound interface b
 * implementing the MakesSound.makeSound() method. (If Cricket does not do this,
 * then Cricket also becomes an abstract class).

     * of Insect. Therefore, to prevent accidental overloading, we use the
