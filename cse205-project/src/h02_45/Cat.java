/**
 * Cat is a specific type of Mammal so Cat inherits from Mammal. Mammal and Cat
 * are related using a generalization (or inheritance) relationship. Note that
 * Mammal implements the MakesSound interface, so since Cat is a subclass of
 * Mammal (which is an abstract class) then Cat must implement the MakesSound
 * interface by implementing the MakesSound.makeSound() method. (If Cat does not
 * do this, then Cat also becomes an abstract class).

     * of Mammal. Therefore, to prevent accidental overloading, we use the
     * @Override annotation.
