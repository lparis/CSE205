// ABSTRACT CLASS: Mammal (Mammal.java)
//
// DESCRIPTION
// Mammal is the abstract superclass for all Mammal subclasses, e.g., we could
// have a Dog class, a Cat class, and a Cow class, all of which inherit from
// Mammal. The Mammal class implements the MakesSound interface because each
// Mammal makes a sound of some sort (we assume so, I don't know if all Mammals
// make sounds).
